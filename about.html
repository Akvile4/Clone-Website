                    <strong>PROLOGUE</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Idle hands is us doing what we love, for as long as we can.</p>
                <p>We believe coffee is a fresh crop with the ability to taste many different ways, and it's a conversation we want to be a part of. Idle Hands is not just for those
                who enjoy drinking, tasting and making coffee, but those who enjoy discussing and researching it.
                Exploration and accumulation of ideas are key. We’re not here to preach, but simply enjoy making our
                shop an experience anyone can appreciate. With a range of quality coffee and brewing methods we want
                every drink to be consistently special. And if it’s not, we want to know.
                </p>
                <p>We put that ethos in to everything we do here; coffee, baking, food, wine, service.
                </p>
                <p>Established in 2014, after many conversations of
                <em>wanting</em>, turned in to jumping off the deep end and <em>doing</em>. Idle Hands first scraped
                together enough courage and energy to pop-up on Piccadilly Station Approach in early 2015. After
                working about 3 months a week, and what felt like a lifetime, we used that platform to find
                ourselves our new permanent home in Manchester's Northern Quarter.
                </p>
                <p>That's just the beginning.

                    <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong>
                </p>
                <p>After leaving Station approach the floor opened up and swallowed
                us whole, forcing a nomadic 16 months upon us, popping up here and there, being set up
                temporarily, and any odd event that we…...you know what, it's been a hard, bumpy ride. Those of
                you that know the full story can fill in the blanks, anyone that doesn’t can ask us over a beer
                sometime. But we hope we're now in the super happy, really long, final chapter*....like every good story ends right?....RIGHT?

                might actually write this book one day. It’s mad.
